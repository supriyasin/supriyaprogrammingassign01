    "   \n",
    "   Method 1: By using Naïve Approach:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this method, the naïve approach will store the value of the P variable in a temporary variable, \n",

    "   value of the temporary variable to the Q variable, which will result in swapping the values of both the variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   P = int( input(\"Please enter value for P: \"))  \n",
    "   Q = int( input(\"Please enter value for Q: \"))\n",

    "   The Value of P after swapping: 43\n",
    "   The Value of Q after swapping: 13\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Method 2: By using comma operator:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We can use the comma operator. We do not need to use a third variable for \n",
    "   swapping the values of two variables for this method.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   We can also use the bitwise XOR method for swapping two variables. The XOR of two variables, \n",
    "   P and Q, will return the number which has all the bits as 1 whenever the bits of the P and Q variables differ.\n",

    "    The Value of Q after swapping: 12\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Method 4: By using arithmetic operators:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this method, we can swap values of both the variable in two ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Using addition and Subtraction operator:\n",

    "       Please enter value for P:  15\n",
